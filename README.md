![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Overview

"Ex Eats Boyfriends" is a humorous and therapeutic take on the classic Snake game, designed to help people move on from past relationships through visual humor. The game features an AI-controlled snake representing your "Ex" that hunts down and eats "boyfriends/girlfriends" (the food).

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Self-playing snake with AI pathfinding algorithm
- ðŸŒˆ Multiple theme options (Pink, Blue, Purple, Green)
- ðŸ‘« Gender customization (Ex-Boyfriend, Ex-Girlfriend, Gender Neutral)
- ðŸ”¥ Adjustable toxicity levels with different motivational messages
- ðŸ“± Responsive design for all devices
- ðŸŽ¯ Score tracking with high score memory

## Live Demo

## How It Works

The snake is controlled by an AI that uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to the food. If no path is found, it uses collision avoidance logic to keep moving safely.
